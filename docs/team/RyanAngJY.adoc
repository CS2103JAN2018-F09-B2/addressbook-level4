=== Enhancement: Unique Tag Colors
==== Why?
Users love visually aesthetic applications! But on a more serious note, different tag colors help users differentiate their tags at at glance.

This feature has been implemented in version 1.1, in PR link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/5[#5].

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=unique-tag-colors]

=== Enhancement: Embedded URL
==== Why?
A user may want to save an online recipe, or perhaps even a YouTube video, into ReciRecipé.

This feature has been implemented in version 1.1, in PR link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/35[#35].

== Other contributions

Below are various non-documentation contributions I have made to ReciRecipé, some of which were crucial to the project:

* Miscellaneous code contributions:
** Morphed the application from AddressBook to RecipeBook, which required changing *the whole code base* while maintaining the interaction of the components as well as the correctness of the whole project (PR https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/32[#32]).
** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage to 93% (PR https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/51[#51]).
** Add new fields (`CookingTime`, `PreparationTime`, `Calories`, `Servings`) and fix the formatting for the old fields. (PR https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/50[#50])

* Project management:
** Managed the milestones on GitHub.
** Added continuous integration tools using https://ci.appveyor.com/project/kokonguyen191/main[AppVeyor],
https://coveralls.io/github/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main?branch=master[Coveralls] and
https://app.codacy.com/app/kokonguyen191/main/dashboard[Codacy] (commits link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/commit/4bbee79bf29fed6255f28869c1fd4443afba5844[4bbee79] & link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/commit/e1f945872d623f578a37246941f529d6b4ba64ea[e1f9458]).
** Reviewed teammates' pull requests both via GitHub and other means of communication, ensured that the pull requests were healthy and had adequate testing.

* Documentation contributions:
** Overhauled the guides (PR https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/81[#81]).
** Added a navigation bar to GitHub pages for ease of navigation (PR link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/77[#77]). (Credits: https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2/main[CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2])
** Added and maintained the link:{repoURL}/docs/Glossary.adoc[glossary].
