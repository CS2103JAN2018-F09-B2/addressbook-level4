== Code contributions

=== Enhancement: Input with multiple lines support
==== Why?
A recipe book needs to have instructions and instructions usually consist of long body of text which contains multiple lines. Therefore, a `_CommandBox_` that supports input with multiple lines is essential for this product.

This feature has been implemented in version 1.1, in PR link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/12[#12].

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=multiple-lines]

=== Enhancement: Keyboard shortcuts support
==== Why?
The changes made to the original AddressBook to support input with multiple lines required some changes to the keyboard shortcuts. For example, the default key to input new lines is kbd:[Enter] but the same key was used for command submission. Thus, it makes sense to use a different key combination to create new lines. To adhere to the coding convention, keyboard shortcuts thus became a separate feature.

This feature has been implemented in version 1.1, in PR link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/12[#12].

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=keyboard-shortcut]

=== New feature: Toggling between themes, adding bright theme
==== Why?
Pictures of food usually are very bright and thus look bad on dark background. Therefore, a bright theme will provide better user experience. And multiple themes require a command to toggle between them.

This feature has been implemented in version 1.3, in PR link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/77[#77].

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=1,tag=change-theme]

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=change-theme]

=== New feature: Searching for recipe on the Internet
==== Why?
This feature removes the need to open a separate browser to add recipes to ReciRecipé. Furthermore, opening the result page directly inside ReciRecipé allows users to faster populate their recipe book.

This feature has been implemented in version 1.3, in PR link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/78[#78].

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=1,tag=internet-search]

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=internet-search]

=== New feature: Parsing a recipe from a website
==== Why?
This feature, in addition to the searching feature, removes the need for manual copy-pasting when the user adds a recipe. This single command can replace a long process of moving mouse, selecting text, copying and pasting.

This feature has been implemented in version 1.4, in PR link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/90[#90].

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=1,tag=web-parse]

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=web-parse]

=== New feature: Downloading an image in-app
==== Why?
This feature complements the parsing feature. With this feature, users no longer need to manually download images to add them to ReciRecipé, instead, they can just run a `parse`, submit the returned `add` command and the image will be automatically downloaded.

This feature has been implemented in version 1.5rc, in PR link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/134[#134].

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=download-image]

== Other contributions

Below are various contributions I have made to ReciRecipé, some of which were crucial to the project:

* Miscellaneous code contributions:
** Morphed the application from AddressBook to RecipeBook, which required changing *the whole code base* while maintaining the interaction of the components as well as the correctness of the whole project (PR https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/32[#32]).
** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage to 93% (PR https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/51[#51]).
** Add new fields (`CookingTime`, `PreparationTime`, `Calories`, `Servings`) and fix the formatting for the old fields. (PR https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/50[#50])

* Project management:
** Managed the milestones on GitHub.
** Added continuous integration tools using https://ci.appveyor.com/project/kokonguyen191/main[AppVeyor],
https://coveralls.io/github/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main?branch=master[Coveralls] and
https://app.codacy.com/app/kokonguyen191/main/dashboard[Codacy] (commits link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/commit/4bbee79bf29fed6255f28869c1fd4443afba5844[4bbee79] & link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/commit/e1f945872d623f578a37246941f529d6b4ba64ea[e1f9458]).
** Reviewed teammates' pull requests both via GitHub and other means of communication, ensured that the pull requests were healthy and had adequate testing.

* Documentation contributions:
** Overhauled the guides (PR https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/81[#81]).
** Added a navigation bar to GitHub pages for ease of navigation (PR link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/77[#77]). (Credits: https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2/main[CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2])
** Added and maintained the link:{repoURL}/docs/Glossary.adoc[glossary].
