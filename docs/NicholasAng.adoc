== PROJECT: ReciRecipé

Welcome to my portfolio page for CS2103T Academic Year 2018 Semester 2 project - ReciRecipé.

== Overview

include::./UserGuide.adoc[tag=applicationDescription]

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability for cloud storage of the data in ReciRecipé.
** What it does: It allows the user to upload all the recipes they have saved in the application onto their own Dropbox account.
** Justification: Saving all of their painstakingly searched, added or crafted recipes solely on their own hard drives is very risky as it could be lost very easily. Furthermore, if they accidentally cleared and closed the app, all the data will disappear too.
This function allows them to retrieve their recipes any time they want from any computer, as long as they have ReciRecipé.
** Highlights: This enhancement involves authentication and authorization from Dropbox. It required an in-depth understanding of the Dropbox APIs and how to handle authorization codes and access tokens.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a new command `tag` that allowed user to search for recipes with the specified tagname(s). [OR search]
* *Minor enhancement*: Added a new command `ingredient` that allowed user to search for recipes with the specified ingredient(s). [AND search]

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/blob/master/collated/functional/nicholasangcx.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/nicholasangcx.md[Test code]]
