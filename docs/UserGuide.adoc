== Introduction

// tag::applicationDescription[]
*<<ReciRecipe,ReciRecipé>>* is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing recipes*. More importantly, ReciRecipé is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (<<CLI,CLI>>) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (<<GUI, GUI>>).
// end::applicationDescription[]
If you can type fast, ReciRecipé can get your recipe management done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Features

// tag::command-format[]
[[CommandFormat]]
*Command Format*

* Words in upper case are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add name/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as *`add name/Chicken rice`*.
** `INGREDIENT` is a list of ingredients, delimited by commas. E.g. `chicken,fish,rice` and `chicken, fish, rice` are valid.
** `INSTRUCTION` can receive multiple lines as its value.
** `TIME` fields accept a number of formats: `1h20m`, `1h20min`, `1 hour 20 minutes`, `80m`, `80min`, `80 mins`, etc. However, sticking to the most simple format `80m` is recommended.
** `CALORIES` and `SERVINGS` are positive numbers. E.g. `120`, `5000`, etc.
** `LINK` takes a valid website address as its value. E.g. `http://google.com`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `name/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as *`name/Chicken rice tag/chicken`* or as *`name/Chicken rice`*.
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), *`tag/rice`*, *`tag/rice tag/chicken`*, etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. E.g. if the command specifies `name/RECIPE_NAME instruction/INSTRUCTION`, `instruction/INSTRUCTION name/RECIPE_NAME` has the same effect.
