== Introduction

// tag::applicationDescription[]
ReciRecipé is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing recipes*. More importantly, ReciRecipé is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
// end::applicationDescription[]
If you can type fast, ReciRecipé can get your recipe management done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version _1.8.0_60_ or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest _recipebook.jar_ link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Recipe Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds (refer to Figure 1).

* Words in upper case are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as *`add n/Chicken rice`*.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as *`n/Chicken rice t/Rice`* or as *`n/Chicken rice`*.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), *`t/rice`*, *`t/rice t/chicken`* etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME t/TAGS`, `t/TAGS n/NAME` is also acceptable.
